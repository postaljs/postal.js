	// ENFORCING OPTIONS
	// These options tell JSHint to be more strict towards your code. Use them if
	// you want to allow only a safe subset of JavaScript—very useful when your
	// codebase is shared with a big number of developers with different skill
	// levels.

	"bitwise"   : true,   //prohibits the use of bitwise operators such as ^ (XOR), | (OR) and others

	"undef"     : true,   //prohibits the use of explicitly undeclared variables
	"unused"    : true,   //warns when you define and never use your variables
	"strict"    : false,  //requires all functions to run in EcmaScript 5's strict mode
	"trailing"  : false,  //makes it an error to leave a trailing whitespace in your code
	// "maxparams":      0,      //set the max number of formal parameters allowed per function,
	// "maxdepth":       0,      //control how nested do you want your blocks to be
	// "maxstatements":  0,      //set the max number of statements allowed per function
	// "maxcomplexity":  0,      //control cyclomatic complexity throughout your code
	// "maxlen":         80,     //set the maximum length of a line

	// RELAXING OPTIONS
	// These options allow you to suppress certain types of warnings. Use them
	// only if you are absolutely positive that you know what you are doing.

	"validthis"    : false,  //suppresses warnings about possible strict violations when the code is running in strict mode and you use `this` in a non-constructor function

	// ENVIRONMENTS
	// These options pre-define global variables that are exposed by popular
	// JavaScript libraries and runtime environments—such as browser or node.js.
	// Essentially they are shortcuts for explicit declarations like
	// /*global $:false, jQuery:false */

	"browser"     : true,   //defines globals exposed by modern browsers
	"couch"       : false,  //defines globals exposed by CouchDB
	"devel"       : true,   //defines globals that are usually used for logging poor-man's debugging: `console`, `alert`, etc.
	"dojo"        : false,  //defines globals exposed by the Dojo Toolkit
	"jquery"      : false,  //defines globals exposed by the jQuery JavaScript library
	"mootools"    : false,  //defines globals exposed by the MooTools JavaScript framework
	"node"        : true,   //defines globals available when your code is running inside of the Node runtime environment
	"nonstandard" : true,   //defines non-standard but widely adopted globals such as `escape` and `unescape`
	"prototypejs" : false,  //defines globals exposed by the Prototype JavaScript framework
	"rhino"       : false,  //defines globals available when your code is running inside of the Rhino runtime environment
	"worker"      : true,   //defines globals available when your code is running inside of a Web Worker
	"wsh"         : false,  //defines globals available when your code is running as a script for the Windows Script Host
	"yui"         : false,  //defines globals exposed by the YUI JavaScript framework

	"predef" : [  // Custom globals.
		"_",
		"define"
	],

	// LEGACY
	// These options are legacy from JSLint. Aside from bug fixes they will not
	// be improved in any way and might be removed at any point.

	"nomen"    : false,  //disallows the use of dangling `_` in variables
	"onevar"   : false,  //allows only one `var` statement per function
	"passfail" : false,  //makes JSHint stop on the first error or warning
	"white"    : false   //make JSHint check your source code against Douglas Crockford's JavaScript coding style
